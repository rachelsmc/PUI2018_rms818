### Review of Karan's Plot

![alt text](ks5063_plot.png)


The plot is easy to read - you can immediately tell which borough has the highest average utility charges and which has the lowest. It might be helpful to include information on the values of the averages so that the reader can decide if the differences between the averages of each borough are significant. In the event that the differences are slight, the colours chosen might exaggerate reality since red usually indicates that an area has extremely concerning attributes. Another thing that pops up when looking at the plot is that the other two NYC boroughs are missing. It could be helpful if there is an explanation in the description.
