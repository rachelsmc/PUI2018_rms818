### Review of Nathan's Plot

![alt text](nbc270_plot.png)


The plot is very readable, the blue and red colours provide a good contrast and can be easily differentiated and read according to the similarly coloured axis labels. It would be good if the resolution of the graph can be improved. One potential issue that could arise is with the scaling of the axes - the lower limit of the red axis is half that of the upper limit, but the lower limit of the blue axis is only 90% of the upper limit. Hence it might be misleading to see that for example in 2010, the red line goes above the blue line, even though the ratio of inmates to incidents generally decreases over time. Otherwise, this is a really interesting plot!
